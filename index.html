        <p>My first choice is my recent discovery and liking of Formula 1 (short for <i>F1</i>) racing. F1 is the highest class of international racing for open-wheel single-seater formula racing cars. A points system is used at Grand Prix to determine two annual World Championships: one for drivers, the other for constructors. My favourite team is Scuderia Ferrari. </p>

        <p>I'm a nerd at heart so for my second choice I would go with watching a lot of different anime. My top anime is called One Piece and it's about a pirate group led by captain Monkey D. Luffy aka "Straw Hat Luffy", in their quest to find the legendary treasure One Piece. This anime has been ongoing from 1999 to present days with more than 1000 episodes, 1000+ chapters and 15 movies.</p>

        <p>Last but not least, on my spare time I like to relax by gaming on my console PlayStation 5. I find it relaxing in similar ways to exercising in the gym because it helps me to clear my mind from day to day worries and just explore the different worlds of gaming. Recently I have not been able to play as much as I like, but as soon as I pick up the controller I feel relaxed again. One of my recent favourites that I played was "Horizon: Forbidden West" which is a sequel of the "Horizon: Zero Dawn" series. It's a postapocalyptic open-world game where you play as Aloy fighting off machine-animals and other human tribes for peace. The next game that I really look forward to is God of War: Ragnarok.</p>
